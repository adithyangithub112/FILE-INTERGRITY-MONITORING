## Setting Up Jira for File Integrity Monitoring Automation

This project uses **Atlassian Jira** to automatically create incident tickets when a file integrity violation is detected.

---

## 1. Creating a Jira Account

1. Open the Jira website:
    
    ```
    https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira
    
    ```
    
2. Create a free Jira Cloud account using an email address.
3. Log in to the Jira dashboard.

---

## 2. Creating a Jira Project

1. From the Jira dashboard, create a new project.
2. Select:
    - **Project Type:** Software
    - **Template:** Bug Tracking
3. Provide a project name, for example:
    
    ```
    File Integrity Monitoring
    
    ```
    
4. Note the **Project Key** generated by Jira (example: `FIM`).

The project key is required for API-based ticket creation.

## 3. Issue Type Configuration

- Default issue type **Bug** is used for integrity alerts.
- Each file integrity violation is reported as a Bug issue.
- No additional customization is mandatory for automation.

## 4. Generating Jira API Token

To allow secure programmatic access, an API token is used instead of a password.

1. Open:
    
    ```
    https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security
    
    ```
    
2. Navigate to **API Tokens**
3. Click **Create API Token**
4. Save the generated token securely

This token is used by the Python script to authenticate with Jira.

## 5. Required Jira Configuration Values

The following details are required for Jira integration:

- **Jira Base URL**
    
    ```
    https://your-domain.atlassian.net
    
    ```
    
- **Registered Email Address**
- **API Token**
- **Project Key**

These values are stored as environment variables to maintain security.
